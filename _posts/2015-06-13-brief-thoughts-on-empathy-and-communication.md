title: brief thoughts on empathy and communication
---

Real quick because I'm not sure I have fully formed opinions yet, but I've made a few observations recently that are gnawing at me.

In a completely unscientific and non-exhaustive poll of folks at RC, I've noticed that when I say, "How's it going for you?" the men respond by telling me about their projects. The women, on the other hand, respond by _first_ telling me how they _feel_ about their projects. At the core we are talking about the same thing: programming. But the women are doing it differently. By responding to my question with a feelings statement, the speaker is essentially activating the empathy part of my brain, which quite literally _makes me care_ about what she's telling me.

So if the speaker is talking to me about, say, Haskell -- a topic about which I know nothing and have no extant intrinsic motivation toward -- I find I'm more inclined to experience actual interest if I've been hooked by good ol' communality.

I don't really know where I'm going with this, but I think that's ok. It's possible there's a takeaway here for men -- begin your project dump with a feelings statement and try to scatter them throughout -- but it's also possible my sample size is hilarious and I'm only seeing what I want to see because I talk primarily in feelings.
