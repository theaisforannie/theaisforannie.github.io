title: 12,000 butts, or How I earned Heroku side-eye
---

Short of me going on a date, this is the story of the most ann thing that could happen.

Our story starts here: I built an as-yet unnamed twilio app, but you can think of it like Magic but for Google search results.

Go ahead and text it yourself! Send it your search terms and it will return a link to the Google search results. Easy!

To do this, I learned [some stuff about HTTP]({% post_url 2015-06-14-incoming-texts-twilio-and-you %}), which was my favorite thing about the project. It made me more curious. I read some more stuff and listened to a practice talk all about HTTP from an RC alum. That night on my way home: 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Learning about HTTP and on the subway thinking about requests and responses and 💥 I just realized what a DOS attack is you guys</p>&mdash; heart++ (@anyharder) <a href="https://twitter.com/anyharder/status/610972069568868354">June 17, 2015</a></blockquote>

We were going across the Manhattan bridge when I had my epiphany, and if you've ever been in the New York City subway you'll know that your phone does this annoying thing where it takes half a bridge to realize it's no longer underground and it definitely has service again, please connect to the network again pleasssseeeeeeee quickly before we go back undergrounnnnnnddddddd. I needed to text [Richo](https://twitter.com/rich0H) before I lost service again. I mean, I'm sure a lot of my friends could have answered this question, but there was never a moment when I wasn't going to text Richo about this:

![wait]({{ site.url }}/assets/sm_richo_dos.jpg)

I want to write an aside to tell you guys about Richo because you get nothing about what he's like here, but this post isn't about him, so here's the short version: 🐤🍻🇦🇺💻🔨 (If only there was an emoji for #yolo.) Richo is one of my favou?rite people.

I got off the train and basically ran home to DOS the only server I've got: Heroku.

`while true; do curl http://tranquil-thunderstorm-666.herokuapp.com/?Body=butts; done`

A naive attempt to be sure, and I _knew_ that, but that didn't mean I wasn't going to do it anyway just to see what would happen. My program needs a parameter request in `Body` in order to not return an error; "butts" is my go-to filler word always because butts are hilarious.

Anyway, Richo told me it wouldn't work. I also talked to my friend Bryan about it, and while he was very happy for me figuring out the thing, he also told me it wouldn't work. Heroku's servers can definitely handle one of me running a single `curl` command on loop.

It didn't work. After 30 minutes the server was still responding with 200 OK, and I broke the loop. 

I wondered how many times it had hit the server in that time. Instead of finding out, I went to bed.

I woke up in the morning to a stern letter from Heroku.

So the thing is, Monday I got the idea in my head that I needed to learn databases. And it's true, I think that's a valuable thing to know about. I mean, for this particular app it's not entirely clear what for, but I wanted to know what a database was and how they're inplemented, so I did just that. 

Or really I didn't, so much as my new RC friend Steven patiently worked through the setup with me, explaining with each bend in the rabbit hole why we were now heading in this direction. This tweet happened:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">three hours later and yak hair everywhere but by golly we got postgres working</p>&mdash; heart++ (@anyharder) <a href="https://twitter.com/anyharder/status/610580264050388992">June 15, 2015</a></blockquote>

You see where this is going?

The database takes the query parameters from each GET request sent to the server and logs them. I can see the zip codes requests are coming from, or count how many requests have come from a given phone number. And of course, the database logs the body of every incoming request.

Heroku has some magical incantations that produce a free, limited-use postgres database. It has limits. Limits you could easily run up against if you hit your server on a while loop for 30 minutes.

Anyway, I didn't actually make any trouble other than to cause an automatically-generated eye-roll from Heroku. But just think of it! You can sleep securely tonight knowing that somewhere in the cloud there's a database filled with nothing but butts.

You're welcome.
