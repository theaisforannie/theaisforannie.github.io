I'm Ann, and I think computers are neat. I used to work at Stripe not as an engineer. Now I'm at Recurse Center (Summer 2015). I think that life is meaningless and enjoy making people laugh about that.

Maybe important?: If I don't say what language I'm in, I'm in Ruby.

I used to use this domain for my grad school stats blog. I cannot figure out how to migrate those old blog posts to Jekyll or I totally would. The site gets its name from [this interaction](https://twitter.com/mc_hankins/status/425692530718437376).
